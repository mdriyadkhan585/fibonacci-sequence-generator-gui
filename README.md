## 🎯 How It Works
The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. This application calculates the Fibonacci sequence based on the number of terms you input.

Here's how the application works:

1. **Input:** Enter the number of terms you wish to generate in the input field.
2. **Generate:** Click the "Generate" button to see the Fibonacci sequence displayed in both a list view and a text area.
3. **Exit:** Click the "Exit" button at the top left to close the application.
4. **Theme Switch:** Use the toggle at the top right to switch between light and dark themes.
